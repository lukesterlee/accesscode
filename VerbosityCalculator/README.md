# VerbosityCalculator

Who is more verbose : Dickens or Melville? 

## Setup up

[Project Gutenberg](http://www.gutenberg.org/) is a digital library. Most of the items in its collection are the full texts of public domain books. For this project we will be using plain text versions of Charles Dickens' [A Tale of Two Cities](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/98) and Hermal Melville's [Moby Dick](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2701)

- Fork/Clone this repository and create a **resources** folder in the project. 
- Save the **Plain Text UTF-8** versions of the above books in the *resources* folder

## Calculation

#### Count
* Total number of words in the entire text
* Total number of sentences

#### Define
* Verbosity = (Total number of words)/(Total number of sentences) 

## Submission

Write a program which given two text files, calculates and outputs:
* Verbosity of each text file, significant up to 2 decimal points
* Answers the question : Which author is more verbose?
